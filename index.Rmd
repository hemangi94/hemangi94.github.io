## About Me

Hi, my name is Hemangi Modi. I was born and raised in Tanzania but have been living in the United States for the past 10 years. I currently live in New York City and I am a graduate student at Columbia University pursuing a Master's in Public Health. I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, playing board games, biking around the city, and trying new vegetarian food options!
