# Introduction

Hi, my name is Hemangi Modi. I was born and raised in Tanzania but have been living in the United States for the past 10 years. I currently live in New York City and I am a 2nd year graduate student at Columbia University pursuing a Master's in Public Health. You can learn more about my professional goals and experiences [here](professional-experience.html)!

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, playing board games, biking around the city, and trying new vegetarian food options! Below are some of my favorite photos from around the city this year:
